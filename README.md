# Advent of Code

https://adventofcode.com/

My goal for each year is to maximize the number of languages I use for
solutions. It's a nice exercise to keep myself fluent in various language
paradigms and refresh my memory on the various APIs.

## 2019

For 2019, I solved or partially solved the days problems in the following languages;

```
C (1), Perl (2), C++ (3), Bash/Sed (4), Racket (5,7,9,11,13,17,19), AWK (6),
Emacs Lisp (8), Scala (10), Go (12), Elixir (14), Java (16), Clojure (22),
Ruby (24)
```

Days solved are in parentheses. As many of the solutions built on the intcode
interpreter, I continued to re-use my Racket implementation for each of those
problems.

## 2020

```
Perl (1), AWK (2,5), C (3), Ruby (4), C++ (5), Bash (6), Clojure (7),
Elixir (8)
```
