# Advent of Code

https://adventofcode.com/

My goal for each year is to maximize the number of languages I use for
solutions. It's a nice exercise to keep myself fluent in various language
paradigms and refresh my memory on the various APIs.

## 2019

For 2019, I solved or partially solved the days problems in the following languages;

```
C (1), Perl (2), C++ (3), Bash/Sed (4),
Racket (5,7,9,11,13,17,19), AWK (6), Emacs Lisp (8),
Scala (10), Go (12), Elixir (14), Java (16),
Clojure (22), Ruby (24)
```

Days solved are in parentheses. As many of the solutions built on the intcode
interpreter, I continued to re-use my Racket implementation for each of those
problems.

## 2020

```
Perl (1), AWK (2,5), C (3), Ruby (4), C++ (5), Bash (6),
Clojure (7,16,18), Elixir (8), Scala (9), Emacs Lisp (10),
Java (11), Go (12), Javascript (13.1), Common-Lisp (13.2, 15.1),
Racket (14, 15.2), Clojurescript (17)
```

Note that Clojure solutions for 7 and 18 use
[`core.logic`](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic), and
[`instaparse`](https://cljdoc.org/d/instaparse/instaparse/1.4.10/doc/readme)
respectively.
